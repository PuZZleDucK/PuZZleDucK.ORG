<P>Trying to remove a broaken link... to embed or not to embed (and the importance of running checkpatch.c)</P>
<BR />
<p>My inspiration for this patch came from simply exploring the kernel documentation and bumping into a couple of links that failed to work, but what a can of worms I opened.</p>

<P>My first idea was to import the documents so that they could be managed in the kernel, the kernelhub website has <a href="http://www.kernelhub.org/?msg=264068&p=2">a good summary</a> of the patch series (<a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-doc/msg10724.html">spinics.net</a> also have a decent summary): </P>

 <div class="code"><code>
 This patch series <br/>
 <ol>
 <li>1. adds "the perfect patch" doc. </li>
 <li>2. adds "submission format" doc. </li>
 <li>3. update refs to perfect-patch. </li>
 <li>4. fix link in perfect patch. </li>
 <li>5. update refs to sub-format. </li>
 <li>6. fix source ref in perfect patch. </li>
 <li>7. reformat  submission format doc. </li>
 <li>8. move other documents into patch sub directory.</li>
</ol>
</div></code>
<p>or:</p>
<div class="code"><code>
  Documentation: Adding "The Perfect Patch" by Andrew Morton<br/>
  Documentation: Adding "Linux Kernel Patch Submission Format"<br/>
  Documentation: Replacing references to broken perfect patch URL<br/>
  Documentation: Replacing reference to broken perfect patch URL<br/>
  Documentation: Replacing reference to broken submission format URL<br/>
  Documentation: Updating a broken link in "the perfect patch"<br/>
  Documentation: Reformatting "Linux Kernel Patch Submission Format"<br/>
  Documentation: Move other patch related document<br/>
</div></code>

<p>This proposal sparked a few <a href ="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/5/24/2">interesting responses</a> :) ... none of them good :( ... with <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/5/24/2">Rob Landley</a> asking the poin question <a href="http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-doc/msg10735.html">"What's in this that _isn't_ in SubmittingPatches? What does having this second file add?"</a> to which I must admit there was no good answer... I had mindlessly imported the document wholesale and (well not mindlessly, I did read it first and there was plenty of good general advice, but) there was no specific requirements stated there that were not in SubmittingPatches.txt. A few other bits of Robs advice rang true, but I felt I should have waited untill they were in the kernel before making the changes... but alas they have to be there to be updated, such is life.</p>
<BR />
<p>So my final patch ended up just being a simple url update:</p>

<p>TODO: <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/5/23/456">Dave Jones</a> also notes a couple of broaken links and outdated infos</p>
<div class="code"><code>
<p>An old reference to: ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots/</p>
<p>And some other text in the file where the regex s/bitkeeper/git/ would do wonders</p>
</div></code>
<p>Thanks Dave :) Links are going on the todo list.</p>
