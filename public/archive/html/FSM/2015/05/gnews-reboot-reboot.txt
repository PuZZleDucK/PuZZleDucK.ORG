## Canonical's policy unequivocally comply with the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and other free software licenses. It does this by adding a "trump clause" that prevails in all situations possibly covered by the policy
-"Ubuntu is an aggregate work of many works, each covered by their ownlicense(s). For the purposes of determining what you can do with specificworks in Ubuntu, this policy should be read together with the license(s) ofthe relevant packages. For the avoidance of doubt, where any other licensegrants rights, this policy does not modify or reduce those rights under thoselicenses"
-Today's "trump clause" makes clear that, for example, Canonical's requirement that users recompile Ubuntu packages from source code before redistributing them is not intended to and does not override the GPL's explicit permission for users to redistribute covered packages in binary form (with no recompilation requirement) as long as they also provide the corresponding source.
